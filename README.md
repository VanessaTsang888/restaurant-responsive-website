# Omnifood Responsive Website Application

Around my full time job (and other software engineering online training courses), I am developing the [Omnifood responsive website](https://omnifood.dev/) which is designed and built by Jonas Schmedtmann because this website application is fully responsive and uses some of the **_latest website technology languages_** including HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6. Alsp, this application includes some organic search engine optimisation techniques and digital accessibility guidlines. All of this is very much inline with my full time job as Software Engineer which the is focuse is on frontend software and website Development.

This responsive website application is the major project within the [Build Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) online training course on the Udemy platform.

The Omnifood company provides an online healthy food ording service via a fully responsive website application which is a popular service since many of us are very busy working full time making cooking declious healthy meals difficult to keep on top of. I am one of those people and this is one reason why I am so passionate about building this Ominifood responsive web application using some of the latest website development technologies.

## Website Development

This training course covers both the design and the development of the Omnidfood website application development. However, since I am a developer my focus will be on the development lectures. This means I will watch the design lecture but not physically do the work. Instead I will save the time for the lecture on web development - coding/scripting.

## Key Concepts

The key concepts for me to learn are as follows because they are extremley important for my full time job:

- CSS3 Media Queries.
- modern flexbox and CSS Grid.
- Planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching a responsive website.

## The Requirements

I already have some experience in website design and development from previous freelance jobs and previous in-person website design and development training courses. Therfore, this course is to up-skill and learn some new techiques in using the latest website application development languages for user interface desgin and development.

This course is also a nice way to reinforce some of the website development concepts I already have experience in which is important for me since I know that information technology develops and moves-on on quickily and part of my job is to keep up with these developments in tech.

This course comes with some very [usful resource](https://codingheroes.io/resources/) and these are also helpful for me to stay on top of the ongoing changes within website development which is needed for me to continue to excel in my full time job as Software Engineer/Developer.

## Test The Application On The Screen

To test my Omnifood website application on the screen/user interface, download the repo from my [GitHub](https://github.com/VanessaTsang888/OmniFood-responsive-website/tree/dev-branch), and open the project locally using an IDE such as VSCode. Use GoLive feature on the botton-right of your VSCode and in a browser window (I reconnmend Google Chrome) navigate to [port 5500](http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html).

### Using the Google Chrome Dev Tools

To inspect the user interface, install and use the Google Chrome Development Tools which is an open source extension. This will allow you to check the HTML elements, the CSS styles and more. You can even temporary make chances to the code for testing purposes if you find this useful.

### Tools

For the IDE I am using the VSCode as this is one of the best tool for the job. I am using various different plugins to help myself develop the application efficiently. Some of the plugins I am using are as follows:

- Auto Close Tag
- Auto Rename Tag
- Colour Highlight
- JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
- Live Server
- Prettier - Code formatter

#### Colour Contrast Checker Tool

Check that the text colour meets the 'colour constrast ratio' on the digital accessibility guidelines: [WCAG 2.1 - Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html). To do this use the [contrast check tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) as the WCAG guidelines has suggested.

## How To Run This Website

Click the 'GoLive' feature located on the botton-right of your VSCode IDE. This will run the website application in Google Chrome browser. Then you will be able to navigate around the website as expected.

## Hosting - Go Live

My [Omnifood responsive website](https://omnifood-vanessa-tsang.netlify.app/) is now deployed on to a live server and hosted for free on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). The URL is: https://omnifood-vanessa-tsang.netlify.app/.

Feel free to test out my Omnifood responsive website.

This website is responsive meaning it works on all major browsers and all major devices including desktop machines, smartphones and tablets. This website also adhere to some of the digital accessibility guidelines including colour contrast ratio requirements as stated on the [WCAG 2.1 Guidelines - Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#contrast-minimum). I have been using the [Color Contrast Ratio Calculator](https://www.msfw.com/Services/ContrastRatioCalculator) to ensure the colours on my [Omnifood website](https://omnifood-vanessa-tsang.netlify.app/) comply to that guideline.
