Show media queries view

Use the Chrome DevTools to inspect the page.
On the top-right click the three dots More options icon.
On the dropdown select 'Show media queries'. This will give us a handy view at the top which will show us what media queries we have set.
When we click on one, it will take us the position of the media query. This way we can see what our page looks like at each of the media queries.

We alrady have media querie at 704px. Now we will create a new media querie of 500px as that is another 200px down.

At 500px we can see the logos no longer fit as they are overlaping each other and the last one is cropped off. How it works sections, the image is now too small and the copy text is too large. Sample Meals, the cards is too small. The Gallery needs to be larger. Pricing section, the plans are too small. CTA, is too small. Duration 3:41.
