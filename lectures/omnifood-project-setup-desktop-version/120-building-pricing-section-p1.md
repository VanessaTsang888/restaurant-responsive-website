# 120 - Building the Pricing Section - Part 1

Pricing table section with CTA buttons.

## The content

For the content, use the content.md file.

## Layout using CSS

Use our pre-made reuseable grid class within a dev element.

## Dummy text

Placeholder text: Plan 1 and Plan 2.

## Infomation hierarchy

The price. The $ symbol needs to be much smaller than the actual figure part of the price. Therefore, we'll format the $ symbol separately using the <span> element.

## Quick Wins

I have made my own small changes that I feel are improvements to this Pricing section

### Btn: Start eating well

I've added a little letter spacing to make the button text more accessible to users with reduced vision and older people.

### List item for STARTER Plan

I have added a fourth list to state that 'access to latest recipes' is not included with this plan because it make the overall layout look more balanced.
